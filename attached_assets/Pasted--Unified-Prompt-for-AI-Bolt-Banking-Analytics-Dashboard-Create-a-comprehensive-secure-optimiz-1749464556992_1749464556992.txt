‚Ä¢	Issued Chargebacks (Chargeback √âmis)
‚Ä¢	Received Representments (Repr√©sentation Re√ßue)

5. Matching Logic (Relationships)
Tables are matched using the composite key:
scss

(NUM_AFFILIATION, AGENCE, COMPTE, AUTHORIZATION, ACQUIRER_REF)
This logic allows tracing direct relationships between chargebacks and representations.
